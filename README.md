Boom.py  #It finds the position and the area of the booms

force.py  #It defines coefficients of the force for different uses, especially in the calculation of the internal forces

inertia.py  #It calculates the inertia from teh booms and it rotates it between different coordinate frames, body frame and the general one

Input_variables.py  #INPUT VARIABLES given for the Boeing 737

internal_forces.py  #Calculates internal forces and moments. It computes deflection, curvature, slope and normal stress of the structure

plots.py  #Generates plot of forces, moments, stresses, displacements, curvatures, slopes (Also in 3D) and it calculates Von Mises stresses

reaction_forces.py  #Calculates the reaction forces of the statically indeterminate structure using equation of motion and displacement relations

shear_force.py  #Calculates the shear flow in the structure, the shear center and the  aileron's twist
